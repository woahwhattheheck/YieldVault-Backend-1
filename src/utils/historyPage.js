/**
 * Shared request handling for cursor-paginated history collections.
 *
 * Both history endpoints need the same six steps - parse and bound the
 * pagination parameters, fingerprint the actor and the filters, validate any
 * supplied cursor against both, run the indexed scan, mint the next cursor, and
 * shape the envelope. Keeping that in one place is what guarantees the two
 * endpoints cannot drift into subtly different cursor semantics.
 *
 * @param {object} params
 * @param {import('express').Request} params.req
 * @param {string} params.collection - fingerprint namespace, so a transfers
 *   cursor can never validate against the audit endpoint even under identical filters.
 * @param {object} params.filters - canonical (normalised) filter description.
 * @param {'asc'|'desc'} params.defaultOrder
 * @param {(args: { order: 'asc'|'desc', limit: number, afterSeq: number|null,
 *   skip: number, maxScan: number }) => object} params.query - indexed scan.
 * @param {() => number} params.countTotal - total matching records; only called
 *   in legacy offset mode, where the response contract promises a total.
 * @param {(seq: number) => (string|null)} params.resolvePosition - timestamp of the
 *   record at an index position, used to reject cursors that no longer describe
 *   the position they were minted for.
 * @returns {{ items: object[], envelope: object }}
